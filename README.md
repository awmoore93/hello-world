# hello-world
This is new repository, used in the startup tutorial. Hopefully this fits fairly well with what I already know about version control.
I am learning this partly so I can use the "download all content" feature in CrowdGrader. I am also learning it because my wife is using this in grad school, and she asked me to help her figure it out and use it.
I have used Subversion before, but I hear this is now what everyone uses.
